## About
Connor and Daniel's lovely little game!

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Gulp
- Some sort of local web server (protip: `sudo npm install -g http-server`)

## Building & Running
After cloning, install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the working directory.

Once you've done that, you can start Gulp by running `npm start`. That should build your CoffeeScript files like it's nobody's business.

Editing and saving files in the `src` directory will rebuild where necessary.

After that, you'll want to run a web server in the `build` directory. That will let you run the game in a web browser.

## Something Didn't Work or I have a question or I need some help and things are kinda strange
Bug Daniel!
