# From the Journal of Captain Mordecai

## About
From the Journal of Captain Mordecai is a game about defeating blocks, and
coming to terms with your one true love: the sea.

## How to Play
You can build the game yourself at the moment. We hope to have it hosted up on GitHub pages soon.

You can play this game in a web browser, or even your smartphone!

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Gulp
- Some sort of local web server (protip: `sudo npm install -g http-server`)

## Building & Running
1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in this repo's root.
2. Start Gulp by running `npm start`. That should build the game, and rebuild when you save changes.
3. Run a web server pointing at the `build` directory. That will let you run the game in a web browser.

## I have a question! Something broke!
Feel free to email Daniel or Connor.
