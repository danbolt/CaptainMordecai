# MunroSavageWeekend

## About
Connor and Daniel's lovely little game!

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Gulp
- Some sort of local web server (protip: `sudo npm install -g http-server`)

## Building & Running
1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in this repo's root.
2. Start Gulp by running `npm start`. That should build the game, and rebuild when you save changes.
3. Run a web server pointing at the `build` directory. That will let you run the game in a web browser.

## Something didn't work or I have a question or I need some help and things are kinda strange
Bug Daniel!
