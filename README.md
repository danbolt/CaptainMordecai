# From the Journal of Captain Mordecai

## About
From the Journal of Captain Mordecai is a game about defeating blocks, and
coming to terms with your one true love: the sea.

## How to Play
You can play the game in a modern web browser, such as Safari or Chrome. You can control and play the game with a mobile phone, too.

At the current time, the game doesn't save the user's levels they've unlocked, so if you close the page you'll lose your progress. We're open to pull requests if anyone's interested!

We have it hosted [here](http://danbolt.github.io/CaptainMordecai/), or you can build the game yourself.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Gulp
- Some sort of local web server (protip: `sudo npm install -g http-server`)

## Building & Running
1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in this repo's root.
2. Start Gulp by running `npm start`. That should build the game, and rebuild when you save changes.
3. Run a web server pointing at the `build` directory. That will let you run the game in a web browser.

## I have a question! Something broke!
Feel free to email Daniel or Connor.
